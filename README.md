# bootstrap-practice-tindog

This is a simple website called tindog that I created.
I created this website by only using Bootstrap.
What I learnt:
1) Different functionality of bootstrap
2) Use bootstrap cdn to link with the html file
3) Use the prebuilt example bootstrap in the development of any website
